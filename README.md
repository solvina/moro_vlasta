An example project to show Spring, Spring MVC, Netty and some other. 

Module proto uses Google protocol buffer project - you need to have a local protoc installed to use it.

Also for Junit5 usage you need to have https://github.com/sbrannen/spring-test-junit5 on your computer (it is enough just clone it and build locally).
